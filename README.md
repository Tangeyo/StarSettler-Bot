# StarSettler-Bot

## Product Description
### Space Colonization Resource System

The StarSettler will be a support system designed to guide the resource logging of astronauts within their progress of exploring outer-space. With the establishment of sustainable colonies on planets, StarSettler is useful in that we can keep track of how many resources each astronaut has before embarking on their journeys.

## Unique features:
#### Resource Allocation Optimization:
Efficient monitoring of critical resources such as water, oxygen, and food levels.
#### Astronaut Health Monitoring:
Data monitoring of active astronauts, logging of possible pre existing health conditions, age, height, weight and space exploration experience.
#### Mission Progress Tracking:
Real time tracking of independent astronauts mission status and found resources on each planet.
#### Inter-Colony Communication:
Personal ID created for each astronaut with their medical information, space experience and previous successful and unsuccessful missions.
#### Sustainability Monitoring:
Monitoring of current and previous missions environmental impact, carbon footprint and generated carbon

## Technologies Used
MySQL: Utilized for robust database management, storing and retrieving data efficiently.

SQL: Implemented for effective query execution, facilitating optimized resource tracking and reporting.

Python: The core programming language used to develop the backend logic and Discord functionality.

Replit: Hosting platform employed for seamless python script execution and project collaboration.

AWS (Amazon Web Services):
    RDS (Relational Database Service): Deployed for managing and optimizing the MySQL database.
